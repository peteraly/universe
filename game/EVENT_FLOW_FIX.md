# Event Flow Fix - Join Action Synchronization

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When users clicked "Join" on an event, the following issues occurred:
1. **Event remained in "For You" feed** instead of disappearing
2. **Event didn't appear in Dashboard** joined events list
3. **Next event didn't become featured** when current one was joined

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **1. Feed Policy Eligibility Logic**
The `isEligibleForMainFeed` function was checking for `event.currentUserAttendee` and `event.currentUserWaitlist`, but our global state management uses `event.currentUserMembership` instead.

### **2. Dashboard State Conflict**
The Dashboard was loading events from mock data in a `useEffect` while also trying to use global state, creating a conflict between local and global state.

### **3. Membership Status Check**
The `isEligibleForMySchedule` function was using `deriveMyStatus()` instead of directly checking the `currentUserMembership` status.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### **1. Updated Feed Policy Eligibility**

#### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
const isNotJoined = !event.currentUserAttendee && !event.currentUserWaitlist
```

#### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
const isNotJoined = !event.currentUserMembership || 
                   (event.currentUserMembership.status !== 'attending' && 
                    event.currentUserMembership.status !== 'waitlisted')
```

### **2. Fixed My Schedule Eligibility**

#### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
export function isEligibleForMySchedule(event: EventWithAttendees, user: User): boolean {
  const myStatus = deriveMyStatus(user.id, event)
  return myStatus === 'attending' || myStatus === 'waitlisted'
}
```

#### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
export function isEligibleForMySchedule(event: EventWithAttendees, user: User): boolean {
  return event.currentUserMembership && 
         (event.currentUserMembership.status === 'attending' || 
          event.currentUserMembership.status === 'waitlisted')
}
```

### **3. Simplified Dashboard State Management**

#### **Before (Conflicting)**
```typescript
const [hostedEvents, setHostedEvents] = useState<EventWithAttendees[]>([])
const [nextUpEvents, setNextUpEvents] = useState<EventWithAttendees[]>([])

// Loading from mock data in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const allEvents = getEventsWithAttendees()
  const hosted = allEvents.filter(event => event.createdBy === user.id)
  setHostedEvents(hosted as any)
  // ... more logic
}, [user])
```

#### **After (Unified)**
```typescript
// Get events from global state
const joinedEvents = getUserEvents(user?.id || '')
const availableEvents = getAvailableEvents(user?.id || '')

// Filter hosted events from global state
const hostedEvents = eventState.events.filter(event => event.createdBy === user?.id)

// Smart "Next Up" ordering from global state
const nextUpEvents = availableEvents
  .filter(event => dayjs(event.startAt || event.startTime).isAfter(dayjs()))
  .slice(0, 3)
```

## 🔄 Event Flow Now Working

### **Join Event Flow**
```
1. User clicks "Join" on featured event
2. Global state updates: JOIN_EVENT action dispatched
3. Event membership status changes to 'attending'
4. Feed policy rebuilds automatically
5. Event disappears from "For You" feed
6. Event appears in Dashboard joined events
7. Next event becomes featured event
```

### **Leave Event Flow**
```
1. User clicks "Leave" on joined event
2. Global state updates: LEAVE_EVENT action dispatched
3. Event membership status changes to null
4. Feed policy rebuilds automatically
5. Event disappears from Dashboard joined events
6. Event reappears in "For You" feed
7. Event becomes available for joining again
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### **✅ Join Action Verified**
- [x] **Event disappears from "For You"** - No longer eligible for main feed
- [x] **Event appears in Dashboard** - Now eligible for my schedule
- [x] **Next event becomes featured** - Feed policy rebuilds with new order
- [x] **Global state synchronized** - All views show consistent state

### **✅ Leave Action Verified**
- [x] **Event disappears from Dashboard** - No longer in my schedule
- [x] **Event reappears in "For You"** - Now eligible for main feed again
- [x] **Feed policy updates** - Event re-ranked and positioned
- [x] **State consistency maintained** - All views synchronized

### **✅ Cross-View Synchronization**
- [x] **Explore → Dashboard** - Joined events appear immediately
- [x] **Dashboard → Explore** - Left events reappear immediately
- [x] **Event Detail → All Views** - Changes reflect everywhere
- [x] **Real-time updates** - No manual refresh needed

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **1. Single Source of Truth**
- **Global State Only**: All components read from `EventStateContext`
- **No Local State Conflicts**: Removed competing state management
- **Consistent Data**: Same event objects across all views

### **2. Proper Eligibility Logic**
- **Membership-Based**: Uses `currentUserMembership` status
- **Status-Aware**: Checks for 'attending' and 'waitlisted' states
- **Real-time Updates**: Eligibility recalculated on state changes

### **3. Automatic Feed Rebuilding**
- **Reactive Updates**: Feed policy rebuilds when events change
- **Smart Filtering**: Events move between sections automatically
- **Dynamic Ordering**: Featured events update in real-time

## 🎉 Final Outcome

**The event flow now works perfectly!**

### **User Experience**
- **Instant Feedback**: Events disappear/appear immediately on join/leave
- **Seamless Navigation**: Changes reflect across all views instantly
- **Clear Visual Flow**: Users can see the impact of their actions
- **Consistent State**: No more confusion about event status

### **Technical Benefits**
- **Robust Architecture**: Single source of truth prevents conflicts
- **Efficient Updates**: Only changed events trigger re-renders
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new views and features

**The global state management system now provides perfect event synchronization across all views, creating a seamless user experience where actions have immediate, visible consequences!** 🚀
