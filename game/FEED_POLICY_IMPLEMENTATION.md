# GameOn Feed Policy Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the comprehensive feed policy specification for GameOn, which transforms the event discovery experience from a simple chronological list to a personalized, intelligent feed system.

## ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

### **1. Feed Policy Engine (`src/lib/feedPolicy.ts`)**

#### **Core Functions**
- `buildFeedPolicy()` - Main orchestrator that separates events into sections
- `computeEventScore()` - Sophisticated ranking algorithm with weighted features
- `rankEvents()` - Multi-level sorting with tie-breakers
- `isEligibleForMainFeed()` - Smart filtering logic

#### **Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
score = 
  0.25 * availability    // Can they actually join?
+ 0.20 * affinity        // Personal relevance  
+ 0.18 * social          // Network effects
+ 0.15 * timeUrgency     // FOMO factor
+ 0.08 * hostReputation  // Trust signals
+ 0.07 * freshness       // Discovery boost
+ 0.05 * distanceInverse // Convenience
- 0.05 * lockPenalty     // Prevents frustration
- 0.03 * waitlistPenalty // Manages expectations
```

#### **Feature Computation**
- **Availability**: Open seats vs waitlist with smart penalties
- **Affinity**: User's sport preferences (0.3-1.0 scale)
- **Social**: Friends attending, host friendship, group overlap
- **Time Urgency**: Bell curve around 24h with boost for <6h events
- **Host Reputation**: Super host, reliability, activity level
- **Freshness**: New events (<24h) get boost, decays over 7 days
- **Distance**: Neighborhood-based proximity scoring
- **Penalties**: Lock time and waitlist size considerations

### **2. My Schedule Component (`src/components/MySchedule.tsx`)**

#### **Features**
- **Horizontal strip** above main feed
- **Top 6 upcoming joined events** (soonest first)
- **Compact event cards** with scrollable layout
- **Empty state** with helpful messaging
- **Analytics tracking** for user interactions

#### **Design**
```typescript
interface MyScheduleProps {
  events: EventWithAttendees[]
  className?: string
}
```

### **3. Feed Section Component (`src/components/FeedSection.tsx`)**

#### **Optional Sections**
- **"Spots just opened"** - Events with new availability
- **"From your hosts"** - Super hosts and close friends
- **"New today"** - Events created in last 24h

#### **Visual Design**
- **Color-coded badges** for each section type
- **Icons** for quick visual identification
- **Event count** display
- **Responsive layout** with proper spacing

### **4. Enhanced EventCard3Lane (`src/components/EventCard3Lane.tsx`)**

#### **New Props**
```typescript
interface EventCard3LaneProps {
  // ... existing props
  compact?: boolean
  showReason?: boolean
  showNewBadge?: boolean
  showSpotsOpenedBadge?: boolean
}
```

#### **New Features**
- **"NEW" badge** for events created <24h ago
- **"Spots opened" badge** for newly available events
- **Reason display** showing "2 friends are in â€¢ Today 7pm"
- **Compact mode** for My Schedule strip

### **5. Updated Explore Page (`src/pages/Explore.tsx`)**

#### **Feed Structure**
```typescript
// New feed policy integration
const feedContext: FeedContext = {
  currentUser: user,
  userLocation: filterContext.userLocation,
  userConnections: filterContext.userConnections || [],
  currentTime: new Date()
}

const policy = buildFeedPolicy(allEvents, feedContext)
```

#### **Render Structure**
1. **My Schedule** - Horizontal strip of joined events
2. **For You** - Main feed with ranked, joinable events
3. **Optional Sections** - Dynamic sections based on content

## ðŸ“Š Feed Policy Rules

### **Eligibility Filters**

#### **Main Feed ("For You")**
```typescript
const isEligible = 
  event.status === 'confirmed' &&
  !userHasJoined(event, user) &&
  isWithinTimeWindow(event, now - 10m, now + 30d) &&
  !event.cancelled &&
  !event.ended
```

#### **My Schedule**
```typescript
const isEligible = 
  userStatus === 'attending' || userStatus === 'waitlisted'
```

#### **Past Events**
```typescript
const isEligible = 
  event.ended || event.cancelled
```

### **Ranking Logic**

#### **Primary Sort**
- **Score** (descending) - Most important
- **Start time** (ascending) - Sooner events first
- **Creation time** (descending) - Newer events first

#### **Progressive Filter Relaxation**
1. **Base filters** (30 days, confirmed, not joined)
2. **Relax time** (45 days out)
3. **Include waitlist** (if still sparse)
4. **Show locked** (as read-only with suggestions)

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- **My Schedule** - Prominent horizontal strip
- **For You** - Main content area with clear section header
- **Optional sections** - Subtle but discoverable

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Scrollable My Schedule** with snap alignment
- **Color-coded section badges** for quick identification
- **Reason text** explaining why events are shown
- **Status badges** for new and spots-opened events

### **Empty States**
- **My Schedule empty** - Encouraging message to join events
- **Feed empty** - Progressive filter relaxation
- **Loading states** - Clear feedback during data loading

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Memoized feed context** to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Efficient scoring** with early returns for edge cases
- **Streaming updates** for real-time capacity changes
- **Lazy loading** for optional sections

### **Data Flow**
```
Events â†’ Filter â†’ Score â†’ Rank â†’ Separate â†’ Render
   â†“        â†“       â†“      â†“       â†“        â†“
Raw Data â†’ Eligible â†’ Features â†’ Sorted â†’ Sections â†’ UI
```

### **Analytics Integration**
- **Section tracking** - Which sections users interact with
- **Ranking feedback** - How well scores predict user behavior
- **Filter effectiveness** - Which filters improve engagement
- **Performance metrics** - Load times and interaction rates

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### **Edge Cases Handled**
- **Empty feeds** - Progressive filter relaxation
- **No joined events** - Graceful My Schedule handling
- **All events past** - Proper Past tab population
- **High waitlist events** - Smart penalty application

### **User Scenarios**
- **New user** - Affinity-based recommendations
- **Active user** - Social and time-based ranking
- **Super host** - Reputation boost in scoring
- **Geographic user** - Distance-based prioritization

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

### **User Engagement**
- **Higher join rates** - More relevant, timely events
