## üìã Next Sprint Goals
1. **Frontend Foundation**: Complete the React dashboard with TypeScript and Tailwind
2. **Backend API**: Implement the Express server with BullMQ job queue
3. **Worker Architecture**: Build the three worker services (data, model, post)
4. **Testing Framework**: Set up Vitest/Jest and Playwright for comprehensive testing

## üéØ Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Basic dashboard with job creation (Week 1)
- **Milestone 2**: Data fetching and geocoding (Week 2)
- **Milestone 3**: 3D model generation with Blender (Week 3)
- **Milestone 4**: Video processing and TTS (Week 4)
- **Milestone 5**: Full integration and testing (Week 5)
- **Milestone 6**: Production deployment and optimization (Week 6)

## üîß Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement proper security measures (rate limiting, input validation)
- [ ] Optimize Docker images for production deployment
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
