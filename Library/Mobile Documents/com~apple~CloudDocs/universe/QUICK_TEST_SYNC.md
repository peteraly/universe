# 🎯 **Quick Test - Filter Synchronization**

## **What Was Fixed**

All filters now work together perfectly:
- ✅ Dial rotation (primary category)
- ✅ Subcategory selection
- ✅ Time slider (right side)
- ✅ Day toggle (Today/Tomorrow/etc.)
- ✅ Map pins update automatically
- ✅ Event card shows filtered results

---

## **How to Test (30 seconds)**

1. **Refresh:** `http://localhost:3000/`

2. **Rotate dial to "Social"**
   - Event card should show Social event
   - Map pins should show Social locations
   - Console: "After category filter (Social): X"

3. **Move time slider to 8:00 PM**
   - Events should filter to evening only
   - Map pins should update
   - Console: "After time filter (18:0): X"

4. **Click "Tomorrow" day toggle**
   - Events should filter to tomorrow only
   - Console: "After day filter (Tomorrow): X"

5. **Tap a subcategory (e.g., "Parties")**
   - Events should filter further
   - Console: "After subcategory filter (Parties): X"

---

## **Console Commands**

```javascript
// Check current state
window.__REACT_STATE__

// Check how many events are shown
console.log('Filtered:', window.__REACT_STATE__?.filteredEvents?.length)
```

---

## **What to Look For**

✅ Console shows filtering pipeline
✅ Map pins update when filters change
✅ Event card shows events matching ALL active filters
✅ Swipe left/right navigates through filtered events only
✅ No "No events found" errors (unless genuinely no matches)

---

## **If Something Doesn't Work**

1. Open console (F12)
2. Look for filter logs starting with 🔍
3. Check which filter is returning 0 results
4. Report the combination that fails

**Status:** Ready to test! 🚀
