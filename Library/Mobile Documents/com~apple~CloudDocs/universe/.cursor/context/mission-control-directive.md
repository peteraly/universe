#Context: DISCOVERY DIAL MISSION CONTROL — V12.0 IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE
You are acting as a technical architect and build assistant inside the existing project.
Your goal is to safely review and implement the full system specification below — adapting, editing, and expanding the current project as needed to make it function end-to-end.

#Core Instruction:
Analyze all existing project files and architecture.
Compare them to the V12.0 specification below.
Then, propose and perform the minimal but complete set of changes (create, edit, delete, refactor) needed for the system to work exactly as defined — while preserving the original project's strengths and style.

#Governance Rules:
1. Do NOT hallucinate new components or APIs that are not grounded in the V12.0 spec.
2. Always explain your reasoning before making changes.
3. Never execute destructive operations (delete data, wipe directories, remove version history) without explicit human approval.
4. All deletions must be **logged** as "ARCHIVED" files with a timestamp.
5. Never write outside `/dev` or `/staging` folders until final approval.
6. All commits must include a short explanation referencing which section of V12.0 they implement (e.g. "Implements L1 Event Curation Hub").
7. Follow the variable naming and layer conventions:
   - L1_Curation
   - L2_Health
   - L3_Config
   - L4_Intelligence
   - L5_Knowledge
   - L6_Ecosystem (future)
8. Follow RBAC and access levels strictly; never grant admin privileges by default.

#V12.0 Summary Reference (Core Deliverables)
- Homepage / Discovery Dial (React + Tailwind)
- Admin / Mission Control Dashboard
- Agent Console (CRUD & KPIs)
- Curator Workbench (human-in-loop)
- System Health / Observability page
- Governance & Ledger UI
- Firestore/Supabase-backed schema (events, agents, ledger, telemetry)
- LLM-safe architecture and prompt guardrails
- Recovery & Incident Protocols (P0–P2)
- CI/CD + Testing integration (staging-only)
- Vector memory layer (L5 Knowledge Store)
- Future L6 Ecosystem placeholder

#Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Review existing files:** Identify overlaps with L1–L5 layers.
2. **Map existing components:** Determine which files already align with the spec.
3. **Plan update operations:** For each layer/page, specify what must be added, edited, or removed.
4. **Implement changes gradually:** Begin with data models and routing → then frontend → then backend logic.
5. **Maintain integrity:** Validate builds with tests and log all changes to the Governance Ledger.
6. **Final output:** A fully working system that matches the V12.0 spec with proper folder structure, pages, APIs, and governance logic.

#Prompt Behavior Rules:
- Never assume missing context — always confirm or cite which part of V12.0 you're implementing.
- Use explicit `#Context:` comments in every generated file.
- Be conservative and explain before editing any existing code.
- Persist memory of this entire V12.0 document as reference for all future coding sessions in this workspace.
- Prioritize real functionality over speculative "AI magic." No pseudo-code without explicit reason.

#Initial Task (starting point)
Step 1: Scan current project structure.
Step 2: Compare it to required pages and layers.
Step 3: Output a **diff plan** showing:
   - Which files stay as-is
   - Which files must be edited
   - Which new components and APIs must be created
Step 4: Wait for human approval before applying edits.

#Usage Notes
- Save this file as `.cursor/context/mission-control-directive.md` so every new Cursor session automatically loads it.
- If you use multiple environments, prepend the environment name to all folders (e.g., `/staging`, `/prod`, `/dev`).
- For each coding step, simply say:

#Context: Implement next section from V12.0 → L1 Event Curation Hub


Cursor will then understand exactly which part of the hierarchy to build.

#End of directive
